A proper environment is needed for this kitchen to function as intened.

You will need the following items installed.

Android SDK

Python 2.6.* (This has been confirmed working.  I am working on Python 3.*)
http://www.python.org/download/

Smali/Backsmali
http://code.google.com/p/smali/downloads/list

Apktool

Any other needed binaries are included in the bin/ folder within the kitchen/
folder.


Step-by-Step
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01.) Install the android sdk.  Most distributions are starting to include this
     now, so check your package manager.  Once you have it installed, make
     sure you have "SDK Platform Androi 2.1, API7" installed with it.
     If you have problems downloading, choose settings, and check "Force https"
     Go ahead and close this program.

02.) Install the Java SDK.
     Almost every distribution has this in it's package manager.

03.) Install python
     If your distirbution doesn't have this in it's package manager, switch
     distro's.

04.) rename the baksmali-*.jar you downloaded to baksmali.jar
     rename the smali-*.jar you downloaded to smali.jar
     Extract the apktool.jar from the apktool*bz2 file you downloaded
     Make sure you downloaded the aptool-install-linux-* also
     Unzip this file
     Copy apktool out
     Copy autosign, signapk.jar, testkey.pk8, and testkey.x509.pem out of the
          bin directory in the kitchen/
     Make sure you downloaded the smali and baksmali wrapper scripts
     Put all of these files somewhere in your path.  You can even create a
     new directory and add the directory to your ${PATH}

05.) Make sure the android sdk toolkit is in your ${PATH} as well as the
     tools directory from the platroms/android-2.1/
     On gentoo, these locations are /opt/android-sdk-update-manager/tools and
     /opt/android-sdk-update-manager/platforms/android-2.1/tools/

06.) You now have a properly setup environment.  You might need to log off and
     log back on for system-wide PATH changes to take effect.
