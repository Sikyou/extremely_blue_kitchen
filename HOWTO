**READ THE README AND NOTES**

The base kitchen resides in the kitchen/ folder.

To use the kitchen, you will need to do the following.

01.)  Put the original cyanogenmod rom in rom_orig

02.)  Edit conf/include_app to include the exact names of apk's you wish to edit.
      (That is, the apks that are in /system/app of the original rom.)
      (Do not include extensions - ie .apk)

03.)  Edit conf/include_framework to include the exact names of jar files you wish to edit.
      (That is, the jars are in /system/framework of the original rom.)
      (framework-res.apk is included by default.  As this is the basis of all themes.)
      (Do not include extensions - ie .jar)

04.)  Edit conf/whitetext, and put TRUE as the only word in it if you want white text
      on the top bars and pulldown area.

05.)  Place your edited images into the kitchen.
      This is done in the brokeout/ directory.
      **
      Under apps, is all of the applications I have edited.
      (I will add more directories now that the simple conf system is in place.)
      In each application directory is a folder named image.
      Inside this directory, you can place your edited images accordingly.
      (ie, drawable, drawable-hdpi, so on.)
      Also in each application directory is a directory named orig.
      This directory contains all source images for each application
      Also included is a sourcenine directory.
      This directory contains my edited source .9.png files.
      **
      The same as above applies to the brokeout/framework directory, although framework-res
      is the only apk you will do that with here.
      Any other directories here include a fixnow and patches for jar files.
      Please do not change these scripts or patches unless you know what you are doing.
      Also, feel free to reuse the services directory as a base to create edit scripts
      for other jar files.

06.)  After placing your edited images and the original rom, move to the base of the kitchen
      directory in a command prompt.  Run the following command
      sh scripts/00_build_theme

      (If you would like a verbose output during build, type the following command instead)
      BEVERBOSE=1 sh scripts/00_build_theme

07.)  When this is done running, you will have a brand new update.zip in the final/
      directory.  Rename this to your theme name, test, and release.  Enjoy.
