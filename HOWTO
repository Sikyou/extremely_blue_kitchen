The base kitchen resides in the kitchen/ folder
All commands are relative to the base folder kitchen/

To use the kitchen, you will need to do the following.

01.)  Put the original cyanogenmod rom in rom_orig

02.)  Edit conf/kitchen.ini - I have left this at the defaults I use to build
      Extremely Blue.  You can edit to your liking.  Be sure to change the apps
      you wish to include and not include by setting the y or n option for that
      particular app.

03.)  There is custom editing using smali and line editing in this kitchen.
      The two apps that I do the most editing on are Luancher2 and Music.  They
      use a custom command script that can be found in include/.  Each script
      is named kitchen_Appname.py.  You can use these as templates if you wish to
      do any custom editing on any other apps.  If you want to do custom scripts,
      you must set the [Appname] option in conf/kitchen.ini with option extra=y.

04.)  Be sure to read the entire conf/kitchen.ini.  If you don't, the kitchen
      will not work.  After reading and editing conf/kitchen.ini, be sure to
      change [ireadthis]isuredid=n to [ireadthis]isuredid=y

05.)  Place your edited images into the kitchen.
      This is done in the brokeout/ directory.
      **
      Under apps, is all of the applications I have edited.
      In each application directory is a folder named image.
      Inside this directory, you can place your edited images accordingly.
      (ie, drawable, drawable-hdpi, so on.)
      Also in each application directory is a directory named orig.
      This directory contains all source images for each application
      Also included is a sourcenine directory.
      This directory contains my edited source .9.png files.
      **
      The same as above applies to the brokeout/framework directory, although
      framework-res is the only apk you will do that with here.

06.)  Make sure your environment is setup correctly.  You can find more details
      on this in the ENVIRONMENT file.

07.)  Once you have a correct environment, and all files placed and edited, open
      a command prompt and navigate to the base directory.  (kitchen/)
      Once in the base directory, type the following command.

           python build_theme


08.)  This will run for a while.  When this is done running, you will have a
      brand new update.zip in the final/ directory.  Rename this to your theme
       name, test, and release.  Enjoy.
