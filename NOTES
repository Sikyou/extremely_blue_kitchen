The scripts use a hexediting program called bbe.
If your distro doesn't have it, you can find it at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbe-/

The android sdk tools folder must be in your $PATH
You must have the smali/backsmali scripts and jar files
in your $PATH

This kitchen uses the following programs and
expects them to be in your $PATH

zip/unzip (as provided by infozip or similar)
patch
bbe
java
zipalign
smali/baksmali

At this time, the kitchen only themes the core rom.  I will include my scripts
to theme outside apps later.  These scripts will buid a seperate zip file for
outside apps.  After some thinking, I don't want to include anything besides
the stock apps in a rom.  If you want to theme more apps then the core, this
kitchen will make it very easy to make a seperate zip that your users can
download.
