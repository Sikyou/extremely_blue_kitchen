This is the kitchen I use for extremely blue.
All of the scripts are bash based.

The scripts use a hexediting program called bbe.
If your distro doesn't have it, you can find it at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbe-/

The android sdk tools folder must be in your $PATH
You must have the smali/backsmali scripts and jar files
in your $PATH

This kitchen uses the following programs and
expects them to be in your $PATH

zip/unzip (as provided by infozip or similar)
patch
bbe
java
zipalign
smali/baksmali


I will make a windows port of the scripts and
programs at a later time.
