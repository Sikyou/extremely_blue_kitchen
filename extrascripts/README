These are the scripts I used to run repetative edits on files

cacall ->
     runs convertandcolorcorrect in a loop fashion

covertandcolorcorrect ->
     runs gimp with some script options to convert files to rbg and color correct
     them after doing so.  (adds the blue)
     **REQUIRES**
     gimp - must be in ${PATH}

crushpngs ->
     runs pngcrush on all *.png files in a directory
     **WARNINGS**
     you can run this on source .9.pngs, but _DO_NOT_ run this on compiled
     .9.png files
     **THOUGHTS**
     pngcrush removes unused IDAT entries in a png file.  It then optimizes the
     remaining data.  I feel this does a far better job then optipng.
     **REQUIRES**
     pngcrush - must be in ${PATH}
